title: Final Project Reflection
---

Throughout the quarter, I worked alongside my group, Puppy Party, consisting of Kyle Fang, Charisse Hung, and Adhvaith Vijay, to create a [webapp](https://pic16b-dog-detector.herokuapp.com/) for those looking to learn more about dog breeds! Specifically, we created a model that can predict a dog's breed based on a photo, and implemented a dog breed recommendation algorithm, where we recommend three dog breeds based on user-inputted attributes.

To conclude this project, we reflected on our final product with the following reflection questions. We wrote the responses to 1-4 together, and I wrote the answers for 5-6 myself.
