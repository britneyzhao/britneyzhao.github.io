This blog post will explain how to visualize quantitative data through a scatterplot using Python using `pandas` and `matplotlib`. 

## Gathering Data

First, let us gather the data about the Palmer Penguins into a dataset that we can manipulate using Python. To do so, we will use the `pandas` module. The method `read_csv` from `pandas` reads a csv file into a `pandas` DataFrame. This will allow us to gather the data so that we can display certain parts of it. This method can work using a website URL that contains the data you want. The following code executes this by reading the Palmer Penguin data from a website containing it: 

```python
import pandas as pd
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv"
penguins = pd.read_csv(url)
```

## Specifying the Categories

Now, we have all the data from the original data set about the Palmer Penguins! To visualize some of the quantitative data on a scatterplot, we need to specify which categories we want to graph. For this example, I will be graphing the body mass (g) of each penguin against its bill length (mm). First, let us create a new DataFrame that one has the following columns of data: species, body mass, and bill length. In the original DataFrame  `penguins`, these columns are called `Species`, `Body Mass (g)`, and `Culmen Length (mm)`. So, we can create a new DataFrame that specifically contains the information in these columns from `penguins` like so: 

```python
bill_mass = penguins[["Species","Body Mass (g)", "Culmen Length (mm)"]]
```

I included the species of each penguin as well so that we can colorcode the graphed data based on species. To categorize the data in this way, we can create Boolean masks for the DataFrame which return `True` if a specific penguin matches the indicated species. There are three total penguin species at the Palmer Station: Ad√©lie, Gentoo, and Chinstrap. In the data set, they are stylized as the following: `'Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)'`, `'Chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarctica)'`, and `'Gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua)'`. Let us create an array of booleans that return `True` when it satisfies the mask operator. In this case, we want to check if the species name of each penguin in the DataFrame matches one of the three species. So, we will create three different masks, one for each species, using the following code:

```python
is_adelie = bill_mass['Species'] == 'Adelie Penguin (Pygoscelis adeliae)'
is_chinstrap = bill_mass['Species'] == 'Chinstrap penguin (Pygoscelis antarctica)'
is_gentoo = bill_mass['Species'] == 'Gentoo penguin (Pygoscelis papua)'
```

## Graphing the Data

We now have all the necessary data to graph in Python! I will be using the module `matplotlib` to graph our scatterplot, so we will need to import this module. To display graphs in Jupyter Notebook, we also need to specify the graphic backend. We can execute both tasks using the following code: 

```python
%matplotlib inline
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

Now that we have imported the `matplotlib` module, we can use functions from this module to create graphs. To plot the scatterplot, I used the function `scatter` from `matplotlib`. The parameters I used for this function are `x`, `y`, `s`, `alpha`, `marker`, and `color`. 

- The `x` parameter indicates what data to use for the x-coordinates of each point on our graph. In this case, we will use the penguins' bill length in millimeters. 
- The `y` parameter indicates what data to use for the y-coordinates of each point on the graph, which will be the body mass in grams of each penguin. 
- The `s` parameter indicates a sizing scale for each data point. This is where we will use the boolean masks we created earlier. Since `True` can be indicated as `1` and `False` can be indicated as `0`, we can scale each specific data point depending on its species. If the penguin matches the species, the dot will have a certain scaling. On the other hand, if the penguin does not match the species, the data point will have a scaling of `0`, which will not appear on the graph. I will scale each valid data point by 100 based on personal preference. 
- The `alpha` parameter indicates the transparency of the data points on a scale of 0 to 1, with 1 being opaque. I will use 0.75 opacity based on personal preference. 
- The `marker` parameter indicates the shape of the data point. I will use triangles, squares, and circles to represent each penguin species.
- The `color` parameter indicates the color of the data points. I will use the colors associated with each penguin species shown in the palmerpenguins art to represent the three species. 

Using these parameters from the `scatter` function, I used the `scatter` function three times, one for each penguin species. Each penguin species has its own specifications on the graph that I have listed above. So, I will use `scatter` like so: 

```python
plt.scatter(x = bill_mass['Culmen Length (mm)'], 
            y = bill_mass['Body Mass (g)'], 
            s = is_chinstrap*100,
            alpha = 0.75,
            marker = "^",
            color = "#b377c9")

plt.scatter(x = bill_mass['Culmen Length (mm)'], 
            y = bill_mass['Body Mass (g)'], 
            s = is_gentoo*100,
            alpha = 0.75,
            marker = "s",
            color = "#4a787e")

plt.scatter(x = bill_mass['Culmen Length (mm)'], 
            y = bill_mass['Body Mass (g)'], 
            s = is_adelie*100,
            alpha = 0.75,
            marker = "o",
            color = "#e0893e")
```

This code will create the graph. However, I also want to label the graph appropriately and manage its size properly. To do so, I will use the following functions from `matplotlib`:
- `xlabel`: This function creates the label for the x-axis of the graph. There is a parameter `fontsize` which specifies the font size of the label. I have chosen 12.
- `ylabel`: This function creates the label for the y-axis of the graph. There is a parameter `fontsize` which specifies the font size of the label. I have chosen 12.
- `title`: This function creates a title for the graph. This title is centered and located on the top of the graph. There is a parameter `fontsize` which specifies the font size of the title. I have chosen 20. 
- `rcParams['figure.figsize']`: This function with this parameter specifically manipulates the size of the graph. I have chosen to assign the graph to have a size of [15,10].
- `figlegend`: This function creates a legend for the graph. This function has multiple useful parameters: 
    - `labels`: This parameter takes in an array of strings to indicate which label you want each point type to have. 
    - `loc`: This parameter specifies where to place the legend. I have chosen the upper right corner of the graph. 
    - `title`: This parameter specifies the title of the legend. 
    - `fontsize`: This parameter specifies the font size of the legend. I have chosen 12. 

Using these functions, we give the graph more context and make it more readable. I will use these functions like so: 

```python
plt.xlabel('Bill Length (mm)', fontsize = 12)
plt.ylabel('Body Mass (g)', fontsize = 12)
plt.title('Palmer Penguins\'s Body Mass vs. Bill Length', fontsize = 20)
plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = [15,10]

plt.figlegend(labels = ["Chinstrap", "Gentoo", "Adelie"],
             loc = 'upper right',
             title = "Penguin Species",
             fontsize = 12)
```

To display the graph, we can use the `plot` function from `matplotlib` like so: 
```python
plt.show()
```
