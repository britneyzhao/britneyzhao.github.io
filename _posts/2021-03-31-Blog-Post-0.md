title: Blog Post 0 - Penguin Data Visualization

This blog post will explain how to visualize quantitative data through a scatterplot using Python, specifically using `pandas` and `matplotlib`. 

## Gathering Data

First, let us gather the data about Palmer Penguins into a dataset that we can manipulate using Python. To do so, we will use the `pandas` module. The method `read_csv` from `pandas` reads a csv file into a `pandas` DataFrame. This will allow us to gather the data so that we can display certain parts of it. This method can work using a website URL that contains the data you want. The following code executes this by reading the Palmer Penguin data from a website containing it: 

```python
import pandas as pd
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv"
penguins = pd.read_csv(url)
```

- bulleted 
- lists
    1. numbered 
    2. lists
    
$$f(x) = e^x$$

Talking about Python code:

```python
import pandas as pd
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PhilChodrow/PIC16B/master/datasets/palmer_penguins.csv"
penguins = read_csv(url)
```

I learned something really cool from my peer feedback! 

```python
def f(x):
    """
    a cool function that multiplies an input by 3
    """
    return 3*x
```

I gave one of my peers a cool suggestion!
